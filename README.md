Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
SOftware engineering is a branch of computer science used for developing , testing and maintaing Software.
reliabity. it ensures software perform as expert without bias especially for critical applications like healthcare, finance.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Mastering complexity
Mastering process
Mastering Machine

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Planing- Identify the software requirement or purpose and scope.
requirement analysis-identify the final user specification.
design-building the framework
Coding-converting software design into tangible code.
testing- examine the software for any bugs and glitches

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology- Linear and sequential, each phase is complated before moving on.
-there is low flexibility
changes are hard to incorporate once a phase is complete.
-Customer feedback comes late, after the product is develop.
-Testing is done at the end of the development process.

agile methodology-lterative and incremental, with multiple cycles (sprints).
-High flexibility, adapt to changing requirements.
-Regular customer feedback is incorporated into every sprint.
-Testing is continuos and done after each iteration.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software developer- developing applications, programs and systems using using programming languages and fireworks.
-maintaining and updating software to keep it functional.
-collaborating with other team members to ensure best practice when developing software.
-reporting to the project manager about the progress of the software development.
Quality Assurance Engineer-collaborate with stakeholders to understand and clarify software requirement
-create development standards and procedures for the programmersto follow
-confirm that the software meets the requirement before deployment.
-analyse the product to identify bugs and suggest changes to make more efficient
-develop and execute automation scripts using open source tools.
Project Manager-assembles and lead the software development team.
-discuss the project and it's requirment with the client and software developers.
-create blueprint for the project.
-tracking and communicating information regarding the project milestone.
-deliver the complete software to the client and regulary check its performance.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software platform that fecilitates the creation of other appilications by providing a space to write compile and debug code, sometimes with value-adding tools that reduce development efforts. eg Visual Studio code (VSCode)
importance:
. Programming language have rules for how statement must be structured.
  Because an IDE knows these rules, it contains many intelligent features for automatically writing or editing the source code.
. an IDE can format the writting text by automatically making some words bold or italic, or by using font color. These visual cues make the source code more    readable and give instant feedback about accidental syntax errors.
. an IDE can make suggestions to complete a code statement when the developer begins typing.
. IDEs increase programmer productivity by perfoming repeatable development tasks that that are typically part of every code change. The following are some     examples of regular coding tasks that an IDE carries out.
. An IDE complies or converts the code into a simplified language that the operating system can understand. Some programming language implement just-in-time compiling, in which the IDE converts human-readable code into machine code from within the application.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
